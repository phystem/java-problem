Assume I have group of departments info with me

And each department has list of students

and I want to fetch a single student who passsed in all subject when i give a department

For ex.

ECE

  EA - 2 arrear
  
  EB - 0 arrear
  
  EC - 1 arrear
  
  ED - 0 arrear


CSE

  CA - 0 arrear
  
  CB - 0 arrear
  
  CC - 1 arrear
  
  CD - 1 arrear


Enter the deptName CSE 

Student - CA

Enter the deptName CSE 

Student - CB

Enter the deptName CSE

Write a Java Program to do the above.
